# Genetische-Kryptoanalyse

Solve masc- and permchiffres with a genetic algorythm

* __.hs__ here is the intelligence of the program.
* __.pl__ this are configuration files for gnuplot.
* __.sh__ this is code for managing the other code.

run ```./doStatisticsMasc.sh``` and take some time.

I never tried this on a system different then mine,
so perhaps some files are missing.
If this code doesn't work for you, open an issue send me a mail.
